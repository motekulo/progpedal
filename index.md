## It has been done already!

Yes.

An early version (2010?), the
[Coyote-1](https://learn.parallax.com/educators/inspiration/openstomp),
although the openstomp links referred to here are no longer working.

A fully blown [Linux based
project](https://popularelectronics.technicacuriosa.com/2017/03/07/pop-the-programmable-open-pedal/)
using the CHIP board (a link there no longer working too).

There are some Arduino projects including the [stomp
shield](http://www.openmusiclabs.com/projects/stomp-shield/index.html) and the
[pedalshield](https://www.electrosmash.com/pedalshield).

Electrosmash (great forums and info in general - worth checking out) have a
[Raspberry Pi based pedal too](https://www.electrosmash.com/pedal-pi).

The project that interested me most, however, was
[Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) based. Sparkfun have a [great
tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/proto-pedal-example-programmable-digital-pedal/all)
and there's a [version 2](https://github.com/akbatt3n/teensy-pedal-v2).

Let me (motekulo@gmail.com) know what others you come across, as it would be
useful to build a more comprehensive list.

## Why do it again?

- I'm in covid-19 lockdown and want to build something while on staycation.
- I actually need a reverb pedal

Some criteria that are important to me:

I don't want to run a full Linux/ Jack setup. I already do that with my home
studio. I want to be able to have the pedal on my pedal board, turn it
on, and have it work.

I only want a few knobs to turn, and not a complex interface to navigate. When
rehearsing or performing, I only have time to tweak a few knobs at most. I have
a Boss GP-10 multi-effects unit (and guitar synth paired with a Godin Multiac)
and can honestly say that I have never adjusted any parameters (other than
tweaking the overall volume knob) while in a rehearsal or while performing.

Ideally, it would be cheap enough so that I could have two or three, each
programmed with whatever effect needed at the time. What is cheap enough? Given
I just spent AUD$200 on an xotic EP boost (which I love), around the AUD$100 or
a bit less would be ideal.

## Status

A breadboard prototype, with line out, and the Teensy still powered via usb.
